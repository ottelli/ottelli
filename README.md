ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Elliott (@ottelli)

I've been writing code for 6 years and building full-stack web applications for the last 3.

In personal projects I like to bring my experience of building wearables, and data visualisation 
tools to the web and mobile, to help athletes (and regular people like myself!)
understand and optimise their training for their goals, values, and lifestyle.
