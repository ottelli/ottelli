ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Elliott (@ottelli)

A Sports Technologist, Engineer, and Founder of Rho Technologies.

I bring my experience of building wearables, and data visualisation tools
to the web and mobile, to help athletes (and regular people like myself!)
understand and optimise their training for their goals, values, and lifestyle.
